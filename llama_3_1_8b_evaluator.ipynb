      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), as well as dust, water vapor, and other particles.\n",
      "2. **Light scattering occurs**: These particles scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described it.\n",
      "3. **Blue light reaches our eyes**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light becomes dispersed throughout the atmosphere and reaches our eyes from all directions. Since we see all the scattered blue light simultaneously, our brain perceives the sky as blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other colors in the visible spectrum, like red and orange, are not scattered as much by the air molecules and particles, so they don't reach us with the same intensity. As a result, these colors appear more subdued or absent from the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Factors that can affect the sky's color:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Time of day**: During sunrise and sunset, the light has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere, which scatters shorter wavelengths (like blue) even more. This is why the sky often appears redder during these times.\n",
      "2. **Dust and pollution**: Tiny particles in the air can scatter light in a way that makes the sky appear hazy or brownish.\n",
      "3. **Clouds and fog**: Clouds and fog can reflect sunlight, making the sky appear white or gray.\n",
      "\n",
