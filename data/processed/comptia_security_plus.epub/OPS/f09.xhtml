<p id="fintro-para-0001">If you're preparing to take the Security+ exam, you'll undoubtedly want to find as much information as you can about computer and physical security. The more information you have at your disposal and the more hands-on experience you gain, the better off you'll be when attempting the exam. This study guide was written with that in mind. The goal was to provide enough information to prepare you for the test but not so much that you'll be overloaded with information that's outside the scope of the exam.</p>
<p id="fintro-para-0002">This book presents the material at an intermediate technical level. Experience with and knowledge of security concepts, operating systems, and application systems will help you get a full understanding of the challenges you'll face as a security professional.</p>
<p id="fintro-para-0003">We've included review questions at the end of each chapter to give you a taste of what it's like to take the exam. If you're already working in the security field, we recommend that you check out these questions first to gauge your level of expertise. You can then use the book mainly to fill in the gaps in your current knowledge. This study guide will help you round out your knowledge base before tackling the exam.</p>
<p>If you can answer 90 percent or more of the review questions correctly for a given chapter, you can feel safe moving on to the next chapter. If you're unable to answer that many correctly, reread the chapter and try the questions again. Your score should improve.</p>

<h2 id="head-2-300">The Security+ Exam</h2>
<p>The Security+ exam is designed to be a vendor-neutral certification for cybersecurity professionals and those seeking to enter the field. CompTIA recommends this certification for those currently working, or aspiring to work, in roles such as the following:</p>
<ul class="square" id="fintro-list-0001">
<li id="fintro-li-0001">Systems Administrator<span aria-label="xxxii" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxxii" role="doc-pagebreak"/></li>
<li id="fintro-li-0002">Security Administrator</li>
<li id="fintro-li-0003">Tier II IT Support Technician</li>
<li id="fintro-li-0004">IT Support Manager</li>
<li id="fintro-li-0005">Cybersecurity Analyst</li>
<li id="fintro-li-0007">Business Analyst</li>
</ul>
<p>The exam covers five major domains:</p>
<ol class="decimal" id="fintro-list-0002">
<li id="fintro-li-0010">General Security Concepts</li>
<li id="fintro-li-0011">Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations</li>
<li id="fintro-li-0012">Security Architecture</li>
<li id="fintro-li-0013">Security Operations</li>
<li id="fintro-li-0014">Security Program Management and Oversight</li>
</ol>
<p id="fintro-para-0008">These five areas include a range of topics, from firewall design to incident response and forensics, while focusing heavily on scenario-based learning. That's why CompTIA recommends that those attempting the exam have CompTIA Network+ and two years of experience working in a security/systems administrator job role, although many individuals pass the exam before moving into their first cybersecurity role.</p>
<p>CompTIA describes the Security+ exam as verifying that you have the knowledge and skills required to:</p>
<ul class="square" id="fintro-list-0003">
<li id="fintro-li-0015">Assess the security posture of enterprise environments</li>
<li id="fintro-li-0016">Recommend and implement appropriate security solutions</li>
<li id="fintro-li-0017">Monitor and secure hybrid environments</li>
<li id="fintro-li-0018">Operate with the awareness of applicable regulations and policies</li>
<li id="fintro-li-0019">Identify, analyze, and respond to security events and incidents</li>
</ul>
<p id="fintro-para-0010">The Security+ exam is conducted in a format that CompTIA calls “performance-based assessment.” This means that the exam combines standard multiple-choice questions with other, interactive question formats. Your exam may include several types of questions, such as multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, multiple-response, drag-and-drop, and image-based problems.</p>
<p id="fintro-para-0011">The exam costs $392 in the United States, with roughly equivalent prices in other locations around the globe. You can find more details about the Security+ exam and how to take it at</p>
<p id="fintro-para-0012"><code><a href="http://www.comptia.org/certifications/security">www.comptia.org/certifications/security</a></code></p>
<p id="fintro-para-0013">You'll have 90 minutes to take the exam and will be asked to answer up to 90 questions during that time period. Your exam will be scored on a scale ranging from 100 to 900, with a passing score of 750.</p>
<p>You should also know that CompTIA is notorious for including vague questions on all of its exams. You might see a question for which two of the possible four answers are correct—but you can choose only one. Use your knowledge, logic, and intuition to choose the best answer and then move on. Sometimes, the questions are worded in ways that would make English majors cringe—a typo here, an incorrect verb there. Don't let this frustrate you; answer the question and move on to the next one.<span aria-label="xxxiii" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxxiii" role="doc-pagebreak"/></p>
<section>
<aside>
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>
<section class="feature3">
<p id="fintro-para-0015"><img alt="" role="presentation" src="images/note.png"/> CompTIA frequently does what is called <i>item seeding</i>, which is the practice of including unscored questions on exams. It does so to gather psychometric data, which is then used when developing new versions of the exam. Before you take the exam, you will be told that your exam may include these unscored questions. So, if you come across a question that does not appear to map to any of the exam objectives—or for that matter, does not appear to belong in the exam—it is likely a seeded question. You never really know whether or not a question is seeded, however, so always make your best effort to answer every question.</p>

<h4 id="head-4-175">In-Person Exams</h4>
<p id="fintro-para-0020">CompTIA partners with Pearson VUE's testing centers, so your next step will be to locate a testing center near you. In the United States, you can do this based on your address or your ZIP code, while non-U.S. test takers may find it easier to enter their city and country. You can search for a test center near you at the Pearson VUE website, where you will need to navigate to “Find a test center.”</p>
<p id="fintro-para-0021"><code><a href="http://www.pearsonvue.com/comptia">www.pearsonvue.com/comptia</a></code></p>
<p id="fintro-para-0022">Now that you know where you'd like to take the exam, you'll need to create a CompTIA account then schedule via Pearson VUE.</p>
<p id="fintro-para-0023">On the day of the test, take two forms of identification, and be sure to show up with plenty of time before the exam starts. Remember that you will not be able to take your notes, electronic devices (including smartphones and watches), or other materials in with you.</p>
</section>
<section><span id="fintro-sec-0008"/>
<h4 id="head-4-176">At-Home Exams</h4>
<p id="fintro-para-0024">CompTIA began offering online exam proctoring in 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. As of the time this book went to press, the at-home testing option was still available and appears likely to continue. Candidates using this approach will take the exam at their home or office and be proctored over a webcam by a remote proctor.</p>
<p id="fintro-para-0025"><span aria-label="xxxiv" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxxiv" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Due to the rapidly changing nature of the at-home testing experience, candidates wishing to pursue this option should check the CompTIA website for the latest details.</p>

</section>
<section><span id="fintro-sec-0009"/>
<h3 id="head-3-279">After the Security+ Exam</h3>
<p id="fintro-para-0026">Once you have taken the exam, you will be notified of your score immediately, so you'll know if you passed the test right away. You should keep track of your score report with your exam registration records and the email address you used to register for the exam.</p>
<section><span id="fintro-sec-0010"/>
<h4 id="head-4-177">Maintaining Your Certification</h4>
<p id="fintro-para-0027">Like many other CompTIA certifications, the Security+ credential must be renewed on a periodic basis. To renew your certification, you can either pass the most current version of the exam, earn a qualifying higher-level CompTIA or industry certification, complete a CompTIA Certmaster CE course, or complete sufficient continuing education activities to earn enough continuing education units (CEUs) to renew it.</p>
<p id="fintro-para-0028">CompTIA provides information on renewals via their website at</p>
<p id="fintro-para-0029"><code><a href="http://www.comptia.org/continuing-education">www.comptia.org/continuing-education</a></code></p>
<p id="fintro-para-0030">When you sign up to renew your certification, you will be asked to agree to the CE program's Code of Ethics, to pay a renewal fee, and to submit the materials required for your chosen renewal method.</p>

<h2 id="head-2-302">Exam SY0-701 Exam Objectives</h2>
<p id="fintro-para-0063">CompTIA goes to great lengths to ensure that its certification programs accurately reflect the IT industry's best practices. They do this by establishing committees for each of its exam programs. Each committee comprises a small group of IT professionals, training providers, and publishers who are responsible for establishing the exam's baseline competency level and who determine the appropriate target-audience level.</p>
<p id="fintro-para-0064">Once these factors are determined, CompTIA shares this information with a group of hand-selected subject matter experts (SMEs). These folks are the true brainpower behind the certification program. The SMEs review the committee's findings, refine them, and shape them into the objectives that follow this section. CompTIA calls this process a job-task analysis (JTA).</p>
<p id="fintro-para-0065">Finally, CompTIA conducts a survey to ensure that the objectives and weightings truly reflect job requirements. Only then can the SMEs go to work writing the hundreds of <span aria-label="xxxix" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxxix" role="doc-pagebreak"/>questions needed for the exam. Even so, they have to go back to the drawing board for further refinements in many cases before the exam is ready to go live in its final state. Rest assured that the content you're about to learn will serve you long after you take the exam.</p>
<p id="fintro-para-0066">CompTIA also publishes relative weightings for each of the exam's objectives. The following table lists the five Security+ objective domains and the extent to which they are represented on the exam.</p>

<h2 id="head-2-304">Answers to Assessment Test</h2>
<section><span id="fintro-exsec-0021"/>
<ol class="decimal">
<li id="fintro-ex-0021">C. The most common reason to disable automatic patching is to avoid issues with problematic or flawed patches and updates. In most environments the need to patch regularly is accepted and handled for office workers without causing significant disruption. That concern would be different if the systems being patched were part of an industrial process or factory production environment. Malicious patches from legitimate sources such as an automatic update repository are exceptionally rare and are not a common concern or driver of this behavior. For more information, see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0022">B. Logs, along with any file that is stored on disk without the intention of being frequently overwritten, are the least volatile item listed. In order from most volatile to least from the answers here, you could list these as CPU registers, the system's routing table, temp files, and logs. For more information, see <a href="c15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0023">A. If Ed can cause his target to disassociate from the access point they are currently connected to, he can use a higher transmission power or closer access point to appear higher in the list of access points. If he is successful at fooling the user or system into connecting to his AP, he can then conduct on-path attacks or attempt other exploits. Denial-of-service attacks are unlikely to cause a system to associate with another AP, and a known plain-text attack is a type of cryptographic attack and is not useful for this type of attempt. For more information, see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0024">D. Site surveys that show relative power on a map or diagram are called heatmaps. They can help show where access points provide a strong signal, and where multiple APs may be competing with each other due to channel overlap or other issues. They can also help identify dead zones where signal does not reach. Signal surveys, db maps, and AP topologies were made up for this question. For more information, see <a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0025">D. A hardware root of trust provides a unique element that means that a board or device cannot be replicated. A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is commonly used to provide the hardware root of trust. CPUs and system memory are not unique in this way for common desktops and laptops, and a hardware security module (HSM) is used to create, manage, and store cryptographic certificates as well as perform and offload cryptographic operations. For more information, see <a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0026">A. Angela needs to retain a password history and set a minimum password age so that users cannot simply reset their password until they have changed the password enough times to bypass the history. For more information, see <a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0027">C. Hot sites are ready to take over operations in real time. Cold sites are typically simply ready buildings with basic infrastructure in place to set up a site. Clone sites and ready sites are not typical terms used in the industry. For more information, see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0028">B. Embedded and specialized systems tend to have lower-power CPUs, less memory, less storage, and often may not be able to handle CPU-intensive tasks like cryptographic algorithms or built-in security tools. Thus, having a firewall is relatively unlikely, particularly if there isn't network connectivity built in or the device is expected to be deployed to a secure network. For more information, see <a href="c11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0029"><span aria-label="xlvii" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xlvii" role="doc-pagebreak"/> A. A dictionary attack will use a set of likely passwords along with common variants of those passwords to try to break into an account. Repeated logins for a single user ID with iterations of various passwords is likely a dictionary account. A rainbow table is used to match a hashed password with the password that was hashed to that value. A pass-the-hash attack provides a captured authentication hash to try to act like an authorized user. A password spraying attack uses a known password (often from a breach) for many different sites to try to log in to them. For more information, see <a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0030">D. Jump servers are systems that are used to provide a presence and access path in a different security zone. VDI is a virtual desktop infrastructure and is used to provide controlled virtual systems for productivity and application presentation among other uses. A container is a way to provide a scalable, predictable application environment without having a full underlying virtual system, and a screened subnet is a secured zone exposed to a lower trust level area or population. For more information, see <a href="c12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0031">C. Derek's organization is worried about insider threats, or threats that are created by employees and others who are part of the organization or are otherwise trusted by the organization. Social engineering involves deceiving people to achieve an attacker's goals. Phishing attempts to acquire personal information through social engineering and other techniques, and shoulder surfing is a technique where malicious actors watch over someone's shoulder to acquire information like passwords or credit card numbers. For more information, see <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0032">A. Corrective controls remediate security issues that have already occurred. Restoring backups after a ransomware attack is an example of a corrective control. Preventative controls attempt to stop future issues. Detective controls focus on detecting issues and events, and deterrent controls attempt to deter actions. For more information, see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0033">C. This activity is almost certainly a violation of the organization's acceptable use policy (AUP), which should contain provisions describing appropriate use of networks and computing resources belonging to the organization. BPA is not a common term in this context. Service level agreements (SLAs) determine an agreed upon level of service, and MOUs, or memorandums of understanding are used to document agreements between organizations. See <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a> for more information.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0034">D. The staging environment is a transition environment for code that has successfully cleared testing and is waiting to be deployed into production. This is where the code should reside before it is released for use. The development environment is where developers work on the code prior to preparing it for deployment. The test environment is where the software or systems can be tested without impacting the production environment. The production environment is the live system. Software, patches, and other changes that have been tested and approved move to production. For more information, see <a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0035">B. Acceptable use policies define how organizational systems, devices, and services can and should be used. Change management policies determine how an organization handles change and change control. Access control documentation is typically handled as a standard, and playbooks describe how perform specific duties or processes.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0036">C. Wildcard certificates protect the listed domain as well as all first-level subdomains. <code><a href="http://test.mail.acmewidgets.net">test.mail.acmewidgets.net</a></code> is a second-level subdomain of <code><a href="http://acmewidgets.net">acmewidgets.net</a></code> and would not be covered by this certificate. For more information, see <a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0037"><span aria-label="xlviii" epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xlviii" role="doc-pagebreak"/> A. The sender of a message may digitally sign the message by encrypting a message digest with the sender's own private key. For more information, see <a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0038">C. This data most closely resembles hashed data, as the fields are all the same length and appear to contain meaningless but unique data. If the field was tokenized, it would be more likely to contain a sequential number or other recognizable identifier. If the field was masked, it would contain asterisks or other placeholder characters. For more information, see <a href="c01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0039">B. Purchasing insurance is the most common example of risk transference—shifting liability to a third party. Avoidance involves efforts to prevent the risk from occurring, acceptance is just that—formally accepting that the risk may occur, and mitigation attempts to limit the impact of the risk. For more information, see <a href="c17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a>.</li>
<li id="fintro-ex-0040">C. Procedures provide checklist-style sets of step-by-step instructions guiding how employees should react in a given circumstance. Procedures commonly guide the early stages of incident response. Standards define how policies should be implemented. Guidelines are voluntary, whereas policies are mandatory. For more information, see <a href="c16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>.</li>
