        "explaination": "Security training typically involves structured and formal programs where employees learn new security concepts and practices. In contrast, security awareness efforts are more informal and aim to keep security principles top-of-mind for employees through reminders, without requiring them to engage in formal learning.\nThe idea that security training involves giving rewards to employees and awareness efforts involve punishments is not accurate. Security training is meant to educate employees on security concepts and practices, not to serve as a platform for rewards. Similarly, awareness efforts are not punitive; they serve to remind and reinforce security principles among employees. The statement that there is no difference between security training and awareness efforts and that both terms can be used interchangeably is also incorrect. There is a distinct difference between the two in terms of their structure and purpose, as explained in the correct answer. Lastly, the notion that security training is only for security team members while security awareness is for all employees is not true. Security training is important for all employees, depending on their roles and responsibilities, to ensure they understand the security protocols and policies. Security awareness, on the other hand, is a continual reminder for all employees, including the security team, to stay vigilant and informed about security practices."
